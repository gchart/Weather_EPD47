# Weather_EPD47

Weather display for the [LilyGo 4.7" ePaper display with ESP32](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-EPD47) using libraries from vroland's [epdiy project](https://github.com/vroland/epdiy/tree/master/examples/weather/) (thanks!) and the Arduino IDE.

Make sure to update the config.h file with your wifi credentials, OpenWeatherMap API key, and regional settings (timezone, imperial/metric, and string translations).

More to come later... likely including a 3D-printed case.
