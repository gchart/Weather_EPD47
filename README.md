# Weather_EPD47

Weather display for the [LilyGo 4.7" ePaper display with ESP32](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-EPD47) using libraries from vroland's [epdiy project](https://github.com/vroland/epdiy/tree/master/examples/weather/) (thanks!)

More to come later... likely including a 3D-printed case.
